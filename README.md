# Ally's Photography
In order to increase Ally's online presence, I worked with her to create a website that would showcase her photos and draw in more visitors. This project ensured a compelling user experience and wide device compatibility by using HTML5 for structure, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap CSS for responsiveness.

By combining these two technologies, Ally's online presence and user interaction increased, and a new benchmark for digital portfolios in the photography industry was established.
